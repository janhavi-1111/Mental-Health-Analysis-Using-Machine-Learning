# Mental-Health-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
# 1.Problem Statement
Using the Depression,Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) questionnare in order to predict anxiety, depression and stress using various classification algortihms.
# 2.Motivation
As a result of modern lifestyles, Many people are suffering from various forms of psychological health problems. Anxiety, depression, and stress all have certain characteristics. Generally, psychiatrists measure anxiety, depression, and stress using questionnaires such as the DASS42 and DASS21, since people who suffer from anxiety, depression, or stress are typically unwilling to share their symptoms . Therefore, we thought that with the help of machine learning we can ease the process
# 3.Methodolgy
# Dataset
kaggle dataset depression-anxiety-stress- scales-responses , which were the DASS 42 form's
responses of people around the globe. • Rows: 35000+ rows
• We mapped the DASS42 to DASS21 to reduce the no. of questions. 
# Tools
• Python ,
• Sklearn library for machine learning models ,
• Plotly for visualization ,
• Algorithms Used ,
• KNN ,
• Naive Bayes ,
• Decision Tree ,
• Random Forest ,
• SVM ,
• Voting Classifier ,
• AdaBoost with SVM as base
# 4.Accuracy
Classification models were trainedonthekaggle dataset to generate modelsforeach algorithms so that the best algorithmcan be later applied for predicting mentalhealth levels in the survey weconductedusing google forms.
# 5. Conclusion
We used 7 machine learning models to predict five severity levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. The models were KNN,Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random forest,SVM and 2 ensemble algorithms. Adaboost and SVM approach gave 100% accuracy for depression,anxiety and stress.
